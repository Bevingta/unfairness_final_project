# unfairness_final_project

This is the final project for Algorithmic Unfairness.

### Data Collection

You can collect more data by running `main.py`. The files will be downloaded to the `Downloads` folder. Currently attempts to use `downloaded.txt` to track files that have already been downloaded, but is non-functional.

## Changelog

**12/02/24**: Imported code from Google Colab, attempted to add download tracker

## File Hierarchy

### `Downloads`
